## Bank Transactions Dashboard

### Question
How can transaction patterns help identify suspicious activity and track account flows?

### What I Analyzed
- I built a dashboard visualizing bank transactions and detecting anomalies.
- Identified large withdrawals and recurring transfers using Power BI filters.

### Key Insights
- Total withdrawals slightly exceed deposits.
- 51K high-value transactions (≥ ₦500k) detected.
- A few accounts consistently show negative balances, which could indicate overdrafts or financial stress.
- Some accounts have stable growth over multiple years, showing healthy inflow management.
