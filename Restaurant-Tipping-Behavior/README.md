## Restaurant Billing & Tipping Behavior Dashboard: Restaurant Tipping Pattern in the US.

### Question
What factors influence tipping behavior in restaurants?

### Dataset
Restaurant billing data including total bill, tip amount, gender, dining time, day of week, and party size.

### What I Analyzed
- Tip percentage by gender
- Lunch vs dinner tipping behavior
- Relationship between total bill and tip
- Tipping patterns by day and party size

### Key Insights
- Customers tip an average of 15%, which aligns closely with U.S. restaurant standards.
  
- Friday receives the highest average tip percentage, suggesting end-of-week dining may create more generous tipping behavior.
  
- Female customers tip slightly more than male customers, with a higher average tip percentage.
This may relate to differences in order types or spending patterns.
  
- Non-smokers tend to give significantly higher total tips compared to smokers.
 This may be because:
- Non-smokers dine in larger groups.
- They purchase higher-value meals.
- They stay longer and order more.

- Tip percentage decreases as group size increases.
 This is a classic behavioral trend, larger groups often rely on shared or split contributions, reducing individuals’ tipping proportions.

- Higher bills generally lead to higher absolute tips, but not higher tip percentages.
